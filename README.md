The index.html file represents the homepage of the website. The file includes meta tags for character encoding, compatibility, viewport, and refreshing. 
The file then links to the external style sheet "style.css" for applying CSS styles to the webpage. It also adds a favicon (favicon.ico) to enhance the visual appeal and recogni-tion of the website.
 
The header section contains a logo and a navigation bar. The logo is a link to the homepage, and the navigation bar includes links to the homepage, a Wikipedia page about football, and the "about.html" page.
 
The main content section includes a skip navigation link for improved accessibility. It also contains a container with images and content related to the joy of football. The im-ages are displayed using the <img> tag, and the content is structured using heading and paragraph tags. 
 
The footer section includes text indicating the affiliation with the University of Liverpool and the purpose of the webpage.
 
Usability and accessibility are crucial considerations in web design to ensure a positive user experience for all users, including those with disabilities. The inclusion of skip navi-gation links and proper heading structure in the index.html file is beneficial for users who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.
The about.html file represents a page providing information about football. The header and navigation bar are similar to index.html, providing consistent branding and naviga-tion throughout the website.
 
The main content section includes two containers. The first container contains a video related to football, allowing users to control playback. The second container includes information about football, highlighting its passion and ability to transcend boundaries. It also includes additional links to external websites related to FIFA and The FA Associa-tion.
The style.css file contains CSS rules for styling the webpage. It includes a reset CSS snippet to remove default styles applied by browsers. The root selector :root is used to define global CSS variables for colours. The header, logo, navigation menu, and ham-burger icon are styled using CSS classes. The responsive design is implemented using media queries to adjust the layout, font sizes, and spacing for different viewport sizes.
 
To prioritise usability and accessibility in CSS styling, it is important to consider factors such as color contrast, font sizes, and responsive design. Research conducted by Van den Haak et al. (2004) emphasizes the significance of color contrast in web design. En-suring sufficient contrast between text and background improves readability for individu-als with visual impairments.
The implementation of responsive design through media queries in style CSS ensures that the website adapts to different viewport sizes, improving usability on various devic-es. This aligns with the findings of a study by Cernea and Dumitru (2014), which highlight the importance of responsive design in enhancing accessibility and the user experience.
 

In summary, the provided code represents a website that explores the world of football. It follows best practises by including appropriate meta tags, using external CSS for styl-ing, and implementing responsive design. The code structure is well organised, with con-sistent navigation and branding elements across the pages. The incorporation of usabil-ity and accessibility considerations, such as skip navigation links, proper heading struc-ture, alternative text for images, and responsive design, enhances the website's inclusivi-ty and user-experience.
